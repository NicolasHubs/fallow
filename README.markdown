Fallow
======

A blogging engine, characterized by inactivity.

I'm more or less teaching myself Ruby as I go, so look at this as nothing more than a learning-by-doing experiment.  Therefore, fallow will likely never function properly for anyone other than me, and that's ok.  Fallow has low aspirations.

*   RSS feeds for tag clouds
*   Tag cloud for `/tags/` (Right now it's a 404)
*   Archive landing page for `/archive/` (Right now it's a 302 to the current year)
*   Pagination and navigation for tags, archive, etc.
*   One-off pages (e.g. "About")
