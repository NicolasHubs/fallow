Fallow
======

A blogging engine, characterized by inactivity.

I'm more or less teaching myself Ruby as I go, so look at this as nothing more than a learning-by-doing experiment.  Therefore, fallow will likely never function properly for anyone other than me, and that's ok.  Fallow has low aspirations.
