  Visited Neuschwanstein with my parents, aunt, cousin, and Elisabeth when they were visiting at the end of March.  I was way busier than I wanted to be, so this was more or less the only chance I took to take pictures while they were here.  I'm not thrilled with most of them (I haven't quite acquired the knack for taking pictures outside); consider these the best of the group, even if not particularly brilliant in themselves.  
  
  I'll take better pictures when I'm in the states at the end of May.  :)
