  Calendaraboutnothing generates a "Sinefeld calendar" based on your commits to public repositories on GitHub.  The idea is simple: each day that I make a commit to some public repository, I get a big, red X on the calendar.  If I make commits every day for a week, then I've got a _chain_ of big, red X's.  The goal is simple: "Don't break the chain." Just _do_ something simple and small every day.  The chain becomes a reward in itself.  In theory.  :)  I suspect this would really appeal to my dad.
  
  I've set it as my homepage... we'll see how the next week or two go.
