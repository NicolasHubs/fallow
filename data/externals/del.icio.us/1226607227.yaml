desc: I haven't actually read through the SEO Starter Guide that Google's just released, but I can already find it pretty amusing that the announcement post on the blog is already jam-packed with spammy "SEO"-types with content-free comments looking for extra hits to their own sites and guides and whatnot.  This, I suspect, was somehow predictable.  I also find it somewhat strange that Google's jumping into this arena at all.  Strange.
