desc: Fresh from the <head> conference, Mike Davies' presentation 'Accessibility First Principles' is a brilliant overview of just what accessibility should mean, what to look out for when designing and reworking web sites and applications in an accessible manner, and the principle of POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust), which was new to me, and seems like a solid way to think about things.
