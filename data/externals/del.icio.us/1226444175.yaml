desc: Ars Technica has a great writeup of the recent Tews/Beck attack on WPA-encrypted wireless networks' protections against replaying packets.  Very solid explanation of the technique (even _I_ could understand it!) and a good outline of what this actually means for your personal network security (very little, _now_, but possibly something substantial with further research).
