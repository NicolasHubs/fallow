desc: Khoi Vinh reaches the conclusion that social networks are part of his job, whether he likes it or not.  I'm not sure I entirely agree.  It's important to have a feel for what's going on, what direction the web is taking, and certainly participation in social networks like Twitter and Facebook can be instrumental in the quest to fend off stagnation and obsolecence.  But forcing yourself to _use_ and _love_ a "necessary evil" isn't good for anyone.  I think Steven Hoober makes this point nicely in the comments.
