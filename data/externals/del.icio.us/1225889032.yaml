desc: Between the action-packed bits of last night's slow trickle of election-related information from the States, I spent a good chunk of time listening to and watching Jonathan Coulton.  I knew him from 'Still Alive', and of course as John Hodgman's troubadour, but after sifting through some of the deeper tracks, I find that I like him more than I expected to.  He reminds me of Cary Pierce, but in a slightly geeky way.  Nice indeed...  This "Primer" is a hand-selected overview of his music to bring you into the fold gently and free of charge; it's worked for me.  I'll probably be picking up some tracks tonight.  :)
