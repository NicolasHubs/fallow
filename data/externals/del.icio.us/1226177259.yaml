desc: A _great_ article outlining the things you should have in mind when considering the impact of your application's performance on your users.  The distinction made between "instantaneous" and "immediate" responses that Weiss quotes, and particularly the answer to "Can your application be _too_ fast?" were eye-opening.  The site is also spectacularly well designed.  I love the look, and I'm already jealous of it and want to make it my own.
