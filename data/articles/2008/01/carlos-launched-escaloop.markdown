[Carlo][] just launched his latest project, [Escaloop][].  It's a nicely structured way of creating a [lifestream][] that pulls in your content from external sites (flickr, last.fm, etc), binding them together into a nicely presented, embedable "badge."

He's done a good job with it, and it couldn't be easier to try out for yourself...  You don't even have to create a user account to get going (in fact, you _can't_ create a user account: they don't exist!).  It's lightweight, and easy to play around with.  Go [try it out][escaloop], you'll like it!
