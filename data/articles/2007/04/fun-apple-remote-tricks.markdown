Let's say, hypothetically, that you have a _funny_ coworker named Uli.  In that case, it might interest you to know that you can [pair an Apple remote with your mac][pair] so that only _your_ remote can activate Front Row.  That would probably save you a moment or two of confusion when Front Row starts popping up inexplicably while you're typing.
