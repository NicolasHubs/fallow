[Rui Carmo][rui] has put together a [great Python script][imapbackup] to pull e-mail from an IMAP server down into `mbox` formatted files that can be backed-up and imported into practically any e-mail program in existance.

It's a work in progress, but it's such a nice utility that I'm already using it to run incremental backups of the e-mail I leave up on the server.
