I'll be at Elisabeth's parents' house for the next few days, celebrating Christmas in the Black Forest.  I hope your holidays are relaxing and fun, and maybe white too, if you're into the whole snow thing.  I think I got enough of that last year to last a lifetime...  :)

When I get back to civilization (ha!), my pre-New Year's resolution is to tackle the hundreds and hundreds of unread messages in my inbox.  I owe many people many e-mails.  Many.

Happy holidays, Internet.
