About Mike West
---------------

<img src="/static/mikewest_is.jpg" class="sidebar" alt="This is a picture of me."> I'm a philosophy student cleverly disguised as an experienced and successful web developer, currently involved with the small team that builds and maintains the European news sites ([UK][], [FR][], [DE][], [ES][], and [IT][]) for <a href="http://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a> in Munich.  [mikewest.org][] is my home on the web, gathering my [writings and links][archive] together for posterity.

Since it was relatively clear early on that it would be slightly more than difficult to make a living sitting under a tree while [reading Kant][kant], I've focused my energies on the web, building a (now defunct) online community of high school debaters, writing articles for [Digital Web][dw] and [A List Apart][ala], and releasing a variety of small [open source projects][github].

My [resume][] is online at [mikewest.org/resume][resume], and slightly more socially available at [linkedin.com/in/mikewestorg][linked].   Take a look, and if you'd like to get in contact, <a href="&#x6D;&#x61;&#105;&#x6C;&#x74;&#111;&#x3A;&#109;&#105;&#107;&#101;&#064;&#109;&#105;&#107;&#101;&#119;&#101;&#115;&#116;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;" class="email fn">drop me an email</a>, direct message me via [twitter.com/mikewest][twitter], or fork a project at [github.com/mikewest][github].
